# AI Foundations: Linear Algebra + NumPy

This repo contains my visual and practical walkthroughs of essential linear algebra concepts used in AI and machine learning, including vector operations, matrix transformations, and dot product intuition. Built with NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter.

## Topics

- Vector addition & scalar multiplication
- Dot product: algebraic & geometric view
- Matrix-vector transformations
